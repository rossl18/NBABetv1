# NBA Betting Dashboard

A beautiful React dashboard for displaying NBA betting opportunities and tracking model performance.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Update `vite.config.js` with your GitHub repo name (currently set to `/NBABetv1/`)

3. For development:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

The `dist` folder can be deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Copy the `dist` folder contents to your GitHub Pages branch
3. Or use GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

## Data Source

The dashboard expects JSON files in `/data/`:
- `latest-bets.json` - Current betting opportunities
- `performance.json` - Historical performance data

These can be generated by:
1. Running `main_workflow.py` and exporting to JSON
2. Using GitHub Actions to run daily
3. Or connecting to Neon database via serverless function
